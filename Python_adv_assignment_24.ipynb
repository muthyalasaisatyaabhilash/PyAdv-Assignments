    "Q1.Is it permissible to use several import statements to import the same module? What would the goal be? Can you think of a situation where it would be beneficial?\n",
    "A.Yes, it is permissible to use several import statements to import the same module in Python. The goal of this could be to have different names for the same module or to import specific functions or attributes from the module into different parts of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2.What are some of a module's characteristics? (Name at least one.)\n",
    "A.One characteristic of a module is that it is a file containing Python definitions and statements. These definitions and statements can be executed during the program’s runtime by importing the module\n",

    "Q3.Circular importing, such as when two modules import each other, can lead to dependencies and bugs that aren't visible. How can you go about creating a program that avoids mutual importing? \n",
    "A.To avoid circular importing, we can restructure the code by breaking the circular dependency. One way to do this is to extract the common functionality that both modules use into a new module, and then have both original modules import that new module instead of each other.\n",
    "   Another way to avoid circular importing is to use lazy importing, where a module is imported inside a function only when it is needed, instead of at the beginning of the program. This can help avoid the issue of modules importing each other during initialization.\n",
    "   It is also a good practice to organize the modules in a way that there is a clear hierarchy of dependencies, where modules lower in the hierarchy depend on modules higher in the hierarchy. This can help avoid circular dependencies altogether.\n",

    "Q4.Why is _ _all_ _ in Python?\n",
    "A.The __all__ variable in Python is used to specify the public interface of a module, i.e., the list of objects that should be considered part of the module's public API. It is a list of strings containing the names of all the objects that should be visible to an external user who imports the module using the from module import * syntax.\n",
    "  By using __all__, a module's author can explicitly control what objects are made available to the outside world and which ones are kept private. This helps to prevent namespace pollution and makes it easier for users of the module to understand what functionality is available and how it can be used.\n",
    "  When a module defines __all__, it affects the behavior of the from module import * statement. If __all__ is not defined, the from module import * statement will import all names that do not begin with an underscore. If __all__ is defined, only the names listed in __all__ will be imported.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Q5.In what situation is it useful to refer to the _ _name_ _ attribute or the string _ _main_ _;?  \n",
    "A.The __name__ attribute and __main__ are useful in situations where you want to have code that can be used both as a standalone script and as a module that can be imported into another script.\n",
    "  The __name__ attribute is a special attribute that is automatically set by Python for each module, and it stores the name of the module. When a module is imported into another script, its __name__ attribute is set to the name of the module. However, if the module is run as a standalone script, its __name__ attribute is set to the string \"__main__\". This allows you to write code that behaves differently depending on whether it is being imported or run as a script.\n",

    "Q6.What are some of the benefits of attaching a program counter to the RPN interpreter application, which interprets an RPN script line by line?\n",
    "A.A program counter can have several benefits when attached to the RPN interpreter application, including:\n",
    "1.Keeping track of the current line being executed: With a program counter, the RPN interpreter can keep track of the current     line being executed, making it easier to locate errors in the RPN script if they occur.\n",
    "2.Supporting conditional branching: A program counter can enable conditional branching in the RPN script, where certain lines of   code are executed based on the evaluation of an expression.\n",
    "3.Enabling loops: A program counter can support loops in the RPN script, where certain lines of code are executed repeatedly       until a certain condition is met.\n",
    "5.Providing performance optimizations: With a program counter, the RPN interpreter can optimize the execution of the script by     skipping over unnecessary lines of code and reducing the number of evaluations of expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7.What are the minimum expressions or statements (or both) that you'd need to render a basic programming language like RPN primitive but complete— that is, capable of carrying out any computerised task theoretically possible?\n",
    "A.To make a basic programming language like RPN primitive but complete, you would need at least the following:\n",
    "1.Arithmetic operators: basic operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are necessary to perform       mathematical operations.\n",
    "2.Conditional statements: to make decisions based on specific conditions, such as if-else statements, are required.\n",
    "3.Loops: to repeat a block of code until a condition is met, you need loops, such as for loops or while loops.\n",
    "4.Variables: to store and manipulate data, you require variables.\n",
    "5.Functions: to avoid code repetition and to encapsulate code into reusable blocks, you need to define functions.\n",
    "6.Input and output: to receive input from the user and display output, input/output functions such as print() and input() are     required.\n",
    "7.Stack operations: to implement RPN, you need stack operations such as push() and pop() to manage the stack"
