    "Q1.Explain the difference between greedy and non-greedy syntax with visual terms in as few words as possible. What is the bare minimum effort required to transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one? What characters or characters can you introduce or change?\n",
    "A.In regular expressions, greedy syntax matches as much text as possible, while non-greedy (also known as lazy or reluctant) syntax matches as little text as possible.\n",
    "  To illustrate this with visual terms, imagine that you have a long rope and you need to find the shortest piece of it that matches a certain pattern. Greedy syntax would start at one end of the rope and grab as much of it as possible until it finds a match for the pattern. Non-greedy syntax, on the other hand, would start at one end of the rope and grab only as much as necessary to find a match for the pattern.\n",
    "  The bare minimum effort required to transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one is to add a question mark ? after the repetition operator (*, +, ?, or {m,n}). This tells the regular expression engine to match as little text as possible. For example, the greedy pattern .* matches any text, while the non-greedy pattern .*? matches the shortest possible sequence of any characters.\n",
    "  In addition to adding a question mark, you can also change the repetition operator to its non-greedy counterpart (*?, +?, ??, or {m,n}?). This has the same effect of matching as little text as possible. However, in most cases, adding a question mark after the repetition operator is the simplest and most effective way to make a pattern non-greedy.\n",

    "Q2.When exactly does greedy versus non-greedy make a difference?Â  What if youre looking for a non-greedy match but the only one available is greedy?  \n",
    "A.Greedy versus non-greedy matching makes a difference when the regular expression pattern contains repetition operators such as *, +, ?, or {m,n}. These operators match zero or more, one or more, zero or one, or between m and n occurrences of the preceding pattern, respectively.\n",
    "  In a greedy match, the repetition operator will match as much text as possible while still allowing the overall pattern to match. This means that if there are multiple possible matches, a greedy pattern will match the longest possible string.\n",
    "  In a non-greedy match, the repetition operator will match as little text as possible while still allowing the overall pattern to match. This means that if there are multiple possible matches, a non-greedy pattern will match the shortest possible string.\n",

    "Q3.In a simple match of a string, which looks only for one match and does not do any replacement, is the use of a nontagged group likely to make any practical difference?\n",
    "A.In a simple match of a string that looks only for one match and does not do any replacement, using a nontagged group instead of a tagged group is unlikely to make any practical difference.\n",
    "  A tagged group (also known as a capturing group) is enclosed in parentheses and allows you to refer to the matched text using backreferences in the replacement string or later in the same pattern. For example, the pattern (\\w+)=(\\w+) matches a sequence of word characters followed by an equals sign and another sequence of word characters, and captures the two sequences in separate groups.\n",
    "  A nontagged group (also known as a non-capturing group) is also enclosed in parentheses, but starts with the ?: syntax. It does not capture the matched text and does not allow you to refer to it later in the pattern or in the replacement string.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Q4.Describe a scenario in which using a nontagged category would have a significant impact on the programs outcomes.  \n",
    "A.Using a nontagged category (also known as a non-capturing group) can have a significant impact on the program's outcomes in scenarios where the regular expression pattern is complex and contains many groups that are not needed for later use in the pattern or in the replacement string.\n",
    "  For example, consider a scenario where you are parsing a large text file containing many URLs, and you want to extract the domain names from each URL. You could use the following regular expression pattern to match the URLs and capture the domain names.\n",

    "  \n",
    "Q5.Unlike a normal regex pattern, a look-ahead condition does not consume the characters it examines. Describe a situation in which this could make a difference in the results of your programme.\n",
    "A.A look-ahead assertion is a zero-width assertion in regular expressions that matches a pattern only if it is followed by another pattern, without including the matched characters in the result. This can make a difference in the results of a program when you need to match a pattern that is followed by a specific sequence of characters, but you don't want to include the sequence in the result.\n",
    "  For example, consider a scenario where you have a large text file containing phone numbers, and you want to extract only the area codes without including the rest of the phone number. The area code is usually enclosed in parentheses, followed by the exchange and subscriber numbers.\n",

    "Q6.In standard expressions, what is the difference between positive look-ahead and negative look-ahead?  \n",
    "A.In regular expressions, both positive look-ahead and negative look-ahead are types of look-ahead assertions that match a pattern only if it is followed by another pattern, without including the matched characters in the result. The difference between positive look-ahead and negative look-ahead is the condition that is required to match the pattern.\n",
    "   Positive look-ahead assertion is a zero-width assertion that matches a pattern only if it is followed by another pattern. The syntax for positive look-ahead assertion is (?=...). For example, the regular expression pattern foo(?=bar) matches the text \"foo\" only if it is followed by the text \"bar\", without including \"bar\" in the match result.\n",
    "   Negative look-ahead assertion is a zero-width assertion that matches a pattern only if it is not followed by another pattern. The syntax for negative look-ahead assertion is (?!...). For example, the regular expression pattern foo(?!bar) matches the text \"foo\" only if it is not followed by the text \"bar\", without including the text \"bar\" in the match result.To summarize, positive look-ahead assertion matches a pattern if it is followed by another pattern, while negative look-ahead assertion matches a pattern if it is not followed by another pattern.\n",

    "Q7.What is the benefit of referring to groups by name rather than by number in a standard expression?\n",
    "A.The benefit of referring to groups by name rather than by number in a regular expression is that it makes the code more readable and maintainable. When you use named groups, you can refer to them by their descriptive names instead of using numerical indices, which can be hard to remember and make the code less readable.\n",
    "  Using named groups also makes it easier to modify the regular expression in the future, as you can change the pattern of the named group without affecting the rest of the regular expression. If you use numerical indices, you have to modify the indices every time you change the pattern of the regular expression.\n",
    "  In addition, named groups make it easier to access the matched groups in the code, as you can refer to them by their names instead of using the group() or groups() method with numerical indices. This can make the code more intuitive and easier to understand, especially for developers who are not familiar with the regular expression syntax.\n",

    "Q8.Can you identify repeated items within a target string using named groups, as in \"The cow jumped over the moon\"?  \n",
    "A.Yes, you can use named groups to identify repeated items within a target string, such as in the sentence \"The cow jumped over the moon\".\n",
    "  For example, you could use a regular expression pattern like (?P<word>\\b\\w+\\b)(\\s+\\g<word>)+ to match any sequence of one or more words that are repeated within the same sentence.\n",
    "  Here, the (?P<word>\\b\\w+\\b) is a named capturing group that matches a single word boundary followed by one or more word characters, and captures the matched word in the named group \"word\". The (\\s+\\g<word>)+ is a non-capturing group that matches one or more whitespace characters followed by the previously captured word (referenced by its named group), and captures the entire repeated sequence in the unnamed capturing group.\n",
    "  When you apply this regular expression to the target string \"The cow jumped over the moon\", it will match the repeated word \"the\".\n",

    "Q9.When parsing a string, what is at least one thing that the Scanner interface does for you that the re.findall feature does not?   \n",
    "A.The Scanner interface in Java is used to parse a string into tokens, which are usually words or numbers that are separated by delimiters such as spaces, commas, or semicolons. The Scanner interface provides several methods to read and parse the input string, including next(), nextInt(), and useDelimiter(), among others.\n",
    "  One thing that the Scanner interface does for you that the re.findall() feature in Python does not is that it provides a more flexible and customizable way of parsing the input string. While re.findall() is useful for finding all non-overlapping occurrences of a pattern within a string, it does not provide as much control over the parsing process as the Scanner interface.\n",
    "    \n",
    " \n",
    "Q10.Does a scanner object have to be named scanner?\n",
    "A.In Python, there is no built-in class or module called \"Scanner\", so the concept of naming a Scanner object does not apply.\n",
    "  However, Python provides a similar functionality for reading and parsing input using the input() function and built-in string methods such as split() and strip(). For example, you can use the following code to prompt the user for input and parse it into tokens using the split() method.\n",
    "   In general, when working with variables or objects in Python, it is recommended to use descriptive and meaningful names that reflect the purpose and usage of the variable/object, rather than generic or arbitrary names. However, there are no strict naming conventions or requirements in Python, so you can choose any valid identifier to name your variables or objects.\n",
